/*
Given two arrays of integers with equal lengths, return the maximum value of:

|arr1[i] - arr1[j]| + |arr2[i] - arr2[j]| + |i - j|

where the maximum is taken over all 0 <= i, j < arr1.length.

 

Example 1:

  Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4], arr2 = [-1,4,5,6]
  Output: 13

Example 2:

  Input: arr1 = [1,-2,-5,0,10], arr2 = [0,-2,-1,-7,-4]
  Output: 20
