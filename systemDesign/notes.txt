You need to design everything for the system. From the Database to the front end and it all


Here are the things I need to think about

-Design a UI for the client to interact with
-Login, use Oauth that can handle thing
  -Never pass credentials to the client side, pass back JWT (JSON web tokens)
-DB for storing information.
  -Relational DB for number things dealing with the account
  -NoSQL database for storing documents, such as the signing for opening an account
-Back end microservice to deal with the relational database stuff like creating an account and transfering
